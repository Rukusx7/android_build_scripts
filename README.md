Android Build Scripts for the SGH-I757M
========================================

These build scripts have been put together to make the build process easier. just run the following from the root of your build directory:

```````````````````
$ . start_build.sh
```````````````````
  
and that should get you started. You will be prompted whether or not you want to clobber your out directory everytime you build.

In future versions of this build script you may be able to define the clobber options at the command line as a set of arguments to the start_build.sh script.
